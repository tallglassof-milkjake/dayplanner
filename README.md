Day Planner using jquery and moment.js

Fill in the details, saves to browsers local storage

reloads upon re-start/ re-fresh of browser

doesn't work. I think I made it too complicated and lost myself going in circles 
trying to get the array to update with the text inputs before saving to storage then 
getting stuck with trying to load the local storage to the screen. Needs some work and 
I will attempt to finish when I have the time.
